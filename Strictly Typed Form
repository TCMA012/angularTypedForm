Strictly Typed Forms
https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2022/04/21/strictly-typed-forms-angular/

Note that the inferred type is string | null and not string. This is because calling .reset() on a control without specifying a reset value, resets the value to null. This behavior is here since the beginning of Angular, so the inferred type reflects it. Weâ€™ll come back to this possibly null value, in a dedicated section, as it can be annoying (but can be worked around).



directly inject NonNullableFormBuilder instead of FormBuilder:

registerForm = this.fb.group({
  login: ['', Validators.required]
});

constructor(private fb: NonNullableFormBuilder) {}



A FormRecord is similar to a FormGroup but the controls must all be of the same type.
