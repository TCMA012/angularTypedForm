typing
Typed forms are great, I was talking about the form values which are not strongly typed and require unnecessary amount of extra work

Like

form = formBuilder.group({ price: [''] })

form.value.price => any

now becomes

form = new FormGroup<{ price: FormControl<Price> }>({ price: new FormControl(null) });

form.value.price => Price
